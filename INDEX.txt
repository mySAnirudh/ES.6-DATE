     The Date object is a datatype built into the JavaScript language. Date objects are created 
with the new Date () as shown in the following syntax.
Once a Date object is created, a number of methods allow you to operate on it. Most 
methods simply allow you to get and set the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and 
millisecond fields of the object, using either local time or UTC (universal, or GMT) time. 
The ECMAScript standard requires the Date object to be able to represent any date and 
time, to millisecond precision, within 100 million days before or after 1/1/1970. This is a 
range of plus or minus 273,785 years, so JavaScript can represent date and time till the 
year 275755. 
You can use any of the following syntax to create a Date object using Date () 
constructor. 
new Date( )
new Date(milliseconds)
new Date(datestring)
new Date(year,month,date[,hour,minute,second,millisecond ])
Note: Parameters in the brackets are always optional.
